# Sals3 — Engineering and Domain Lessons

> [!IMPORTANT] Purpose
> Consolidated, numbered lessons from real incidents — not speculative best practices. Each entry exists because something actually broke or surprised someone, once real build work happens.

Add a new numbered skill in the same task the underlying incident is fixed or the lesson is confirmed. Reference it from `hot.md` and, if code-adjacent, from the relevant commit or session note.

## Skills

### 1. Next.js 16 image quality values are allow-listed

**Confirmed:** 2026-08-05, during the landing-page promo carousel implementation.

**Incident:** `next/image` rendered carousel images with `quality={85}`. The page worked, but Playwright surfaced a Next.js warning: the configured `images.qualities` value was `[75]`, so `85` was not allowed.

**Lesson:** In Next.js 16, do not set a custom `quality` value unless `next.config.ts` explicitly allows it. Prefer default quality for normal ecommerce banners, or update `images.qualities` intentionally and rerun build/E2E.

**Where applied:** `PromoCarousel` now uses default `next/image` quality.

### 2. Typecheck-clean temp folders can poison lint

**Confirmed:** 2026-08-05, during full validation after carousel work.

**Incident:** An interrupted or failed clean typecheck left `.next-typecheck-tmp-*` in the project root. ESLint then scanned generated Turbopack output and reported hundreds of thousands of irrelevant errors.

**Lesson:** Before trusting lint failures after `npm run typecheck:clean`, check for `.next-typecheck-tmp-*`. Clean generated temp folders and keep them ignored in ESLint. Do not fix generated Next.js output.

**Where applied:** `eslint.config.mjs` now ignores `.next-typecheck-tmp-*/**`.

### 3. Prompt-attached images must become verified local assets

**Confirmed:** 2026-08-05, during the carousel image replacement.

**Incident:** The prompt showed multiple carousel images, but only one unrelated clipboard image was visible in the temp attachment path. The real banner files were found in `~/Downloads` and verified by filename, dimensions, and visual inspection before use.

**Lesson:** Do not assume chat-visible images are usable project assets. Search local files, verify dimensions and content, copy only the intended files into `public/` with safe names, and use `next/image` with stable dimensions.

**Where applied:** Seven verified 1734 x 662 banner PNGs now live in `public/home-promos/`.

### 4. Ecommerce promo carousels need manual, testable controls

**Confirmed:** 2026-08-05, during the Embla carousel implementation.

**Incident:** The replacement component needed to remove a static promo banner without creating motion, accessibility, or layout risk.

**Lesson:** For ecommerce promo banners, default to no autoplay, 44px-plus controls, dot navigation, meaningful alt text, stable aspect ratio, and E2E checks for both desktop and mobile. Verify `naturalWidth > 0` and no horizontal page overflow.

**Where applied:** `PromoCarousel` uses Embla manual controls, `next/image`, desktop/mobile Playwright checks, and no autoplay.
